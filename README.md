Patenten idea to increse aganist compromise atempt
So far, one of the most reliable security features, where the detectors,
contacts, etc. are hardwired connected to the control unit. These solutions
allow to avoid the problem of sniffing the data related to the signal
transmission that exists in wireless solutions.
Unfortunately, I have discovered a very easy way to block the hardwired
detectors and contacts and have published these stories about it on
the Hacker Magazine 2600 issue: spring 2017.
A video with a short example can be seen that shows on conducting out the real
attack on blocking a sensor, https://youtu.be/_jSeOGATPjw ,
and on https://www.scribd.com/document/408211945/Arduino-Project-Burglar-Zone-
input-Tester
That was the fact that led me to find a technical solution that would eliminate
the threat of blocking the sensors and contacts of the security systems and so
my idea was patented.
Currently, I am working on the design schematics of a device, which as an
additional module kit will be connected to already existing and installed
burglar alarm systems or access control systems and will make these protections
extremely difficult to block and costs of these implementations will be low and
with the easy installation process.
The principle of operation of the device is simple, replacing the supply of the
loop with constant voltage with a new supply voltage characterized by constantly
changing the voltage of a random value.

I have already developed the analog circuits of the device and are currently
working on the controlling sub-circuits based on the microprocessor.
In the end, I would like to emphasize that on the basis of patents, you can also
improve car's alarms and increase the security level of industrial facilities
such as airports, power plants, water treatment plans, gasoline pipes, and banks
security system.
I hope that it may be expected of the need of thousands and more such devices to
be in market demands.
I would like you to consider my proposition of purchasing my patents
US20170213432A1, CA 2946923 as well as Poland No. 231286B1.
